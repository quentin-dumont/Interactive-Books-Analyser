            "In the northern land of Sommerlund, it has been the custom for many\ncenturies to send the children of the Warrior Lords to the monastery\nof Kai. There they are taught the skills and disciplines of their\nnoble fathers."
        ],
        "In olden times, during the Age of the Black Moon, the Darklords waged\nwar on Sommerlund. The conflict was a long and bitter trial of\nstrength that ended in victory for the Sommlending at the great battle\nof Maakengorge. King Ulnar and the allies of Durenor broke the\nDarklord armies at the pass of Moytura and forced them back into the\nbottomless abyss of Maakengorge. Vashna, mightiest of the Darklords,\nwas slain upon the sword of King Ulnar, called \u2018Sommerswerd\u2019, the\nsword of the sun. Since that age, the Darklords have vowed vengeance\nupon Sommerlund and the House of Ulnar.",
        "You are Lone Wolf, a young Kai initiate who was learning the secret\nskills of the Kai Lords. Two days ago, your peaceful country was\nplunged into war when a vast Darklord army suddenly invaded Sommerlund\nand completely destroyed the Kai Monastery. All the Kai Lords were in\nattendance for the feast of Fehmarn, and all were killed as the\nmonastery was surrounded and destroyed, the walls collapsing in on the\nassembled company. You, the only Kai Lord to survive the massacre,\nvowed then to avenge their deaths. You knew your first task had to be\nto warn the King, for without the Kai Lords to lead her armies, your\ncountry, Sommerlund, would be unable to mobilize in time to drive the\nDarklords back.",
        "Your journey to the capital was perilous indeed. The enemy had overrun\nmuch of the country and were marching upon Holmgard, the capital\nitself. But despite the many dangers, you fought your way through to\nthe capital and delivered your warning to the King\u2019s court. There you\nwere greatly praised for your skill and bravery but told your mission\nwas not complete: with the Kai Lords dead, there remained only one\npower in all of Magnamund that could save your people from the\nDarklords\u2014the Sommerswerd.",
        "After the defeat of Vashna, the Sommerswerd had been bestowed upon the\nallies of Durenor as a mark of trust and allegiance that exists\nbetween the two kingdoms. In return, King Alin of Durenor gave\nSommerlund a magnificent golden ring bearing the royal arms of\nDurenor. This ring is known as the Seal of Hammerdal. At that time,\nKing Alin vowed that if ever the shadow of the west should rise again\nto threaten Sommerlund, Durenor would come to the aid of her ally.",
        "The King has given you the Seal of Hammerdal. Your quest is to travel\nto Durenor to fetch the Sommerswerd back. But meanwhile the enemy have\nbroken through the outer defences to the capital and are preparing to\nbesiege the city wall. As Captain D\u2019Val of the King\u2019s Guard leads you\nto the Royal Armoury to equip you for your mission, the King\u2019s words\nkeep coming back to you:",

In a town or\ncity, it enables him to look and sound like a native of that area, and\ncan help him to find shelter or a safe hiding place.",

As the dish spins, she drops a small silver ball into it which\neventually comes to rest in one of the numbered sections.

Make a note of these\nnumbers and then pick a number from the Random Number Table. If you pick exactly\nthe same number, you win 8 Gold Crowns for every 1 Gold Crown that you gamble.\nIf the number you pick is immediately before or after the correct choice, you\nwin 5 Gold Crowns for every 1 Gold Crown that you stake. There is a limit to how\nmuch you can win on this table: 40 Gold Crowns.\n\nYou may play as many rounds of \"Cartwheel\" as you wish until either you lose all\nyour Gold Crowns, or you decide to pick up your winnings (maximum of 40 Gold\nCrowns).",

The Darklords' army with their evil engines of war surround the walls,\nand the flaming arcs of fireballs shooting through the air continually light the\nnight sky as they rain down on the streets below. The people fight the fire as\nbest they can, but they are hungry and exhausted and close to surrender. At\nfirst, as it enters the harbour, the fleet is mistaken for the enemy and cries\nof despair can be heard all along the quay. But as the first of the soldiers set\nfoot in the city and unfurl the royal arms of Durenor, the news of your return\nspreads quickly. The cries of despair have changed to a chorus of cheers: \"The\nKai Lord has returned.\"\n\nYou are standing at the top of the great watchtower, high above the main gate of\nthe city, when the first light of dawn creeps slowly over the horizon. Thousand\nupon thousand of the black-clad enemy are massed around the city wall, huddled\nlike beetles in the trenches that cover the plain. In the midst of this horde, a\ngreat red tent has been erected bearing the symbol of a broken skull. It is the\nmark of Zagarna, Lord of Kaag, a Darklord of Helgedad. His great ambition is the\ndestruction of Holmgard; his fiercest desire to lead his army to victory over\nthe House of Ulnar and claim Sommerlund for his own.\n\nBut victory is not to be his this day. Raising the Sommerswerd high above your\nhead, a shaft of dawn sunlight catches upon the tip of the golden sword and a\nbrilliant flash of blinding white flame runs the entire length of the blade. The\npower of the Sommerswerd electrifies you. Your senses reel and now your body\nreacts instinctively. You lower the Sommerswerd and point the blade towards the\ntent of Lord Zagarna. There is a mighty roar as the power of the sun-sword is\nunleashed in a searing white beam. The tent explodes and a brilliant fireball of\nwhite flame mushrooms skyward. A long and terrible cry rends the air. It is Lord\nZagarna. The leader of the evil army is no more.\n\nhttp://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml/lw/02fotw//ill20.png[Illustration]: There is a mighty roar as the power of the sun-sword is unleashed\nin a searing white beam.\n\nGripped with fear and panic, the vast black army rise up and run in chaos from\nthe city wall. The impossible has happened, their invincible master is slain.\nAgain the Sommerswerd has returned to defeat them. The army and the allies of\nDurenor ride out of the city gates in pursuit of the panic-stricken enemy as\nthey run blindly towards the Durncrag Mountains. The victory is yours. Holmgard\nis saved and the murder of the Kai has finally been avenged.\n\nBut for you, Lone Wolf, a life of high adventure has only just begun. A new\nchallenge awaits you and the Sommerswerd in Book Three of the Lone Wolf series:\n\nThe Caverns of Kalte",
